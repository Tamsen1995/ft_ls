> Redo the sorting of arguments using linked list
    Since the sorting of directories is 
    also affected by the various flags
    I now need to put this into consideration
- In the sort_args function we make a linked list
out of the 2d array
- declare such an arguments list in the header
- sort the list dynamically using the array
- do so using the same or similar logic as in the lstadd_sort
