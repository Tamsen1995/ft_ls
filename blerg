git commit -m "So after having implemented a prototype of the recursive output of all elements within the stack, I have decided to construct the program in such a way that gives way to two kinds of outputs. A recursive one as well as a normal one. The treatment and formatting of flags will be quite identical in the two of them. The only difference will  be the recursion within onr of the output systems. I am doing this because the flow will be a lot easier to manage and it will render the code a lot more modular."
