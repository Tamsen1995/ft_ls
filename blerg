git commit -m "[FIX] Fixing the slash. 
Right now there is a segfault in the handle single file function when it is 
called to handle a directory for which I don't have permissions. 
Also my ls crashes when I don't have permissions for a directory, 
instead of saying that it doesn't have permission and continuing on its path."
