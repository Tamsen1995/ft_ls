This is the ls command recoded. I am doing this in order to familiarize myself with the unix system.
Usage is identical to the normal ls command (ls man) except instead of ls you need to use ./ft_ls


Project Journal:
    Thus far I have implemented the parsing of the flags. The parsing module returns to me the number of flags present
    while simoultaneously declaring a character array which indicates the flags in the user would like to use by the position of the indexed 1.
    in order to text this you oughta iterate through the array NB_FLAGS (6) times.
