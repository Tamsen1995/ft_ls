    Restructuring my code to fit Nathan's Logic
I am currently in the process of restructuring my code so that it will imitate the logic of my friend nathan's code.

    Parsing Of the Flags
I have thus far been able to re-implement the counting of flags into my code and have put this into the parsing module
This module includes the parsing of the flags which are going to come in as input through the standards input.
With the help of a pre-defined set of flags which are valid, I am able to determine whether the given flags are valid or not.

    Using an array to determine flags whose validity is pre-defined
Also I understand that in the passed flag array, each index position stands for a particular flag of the ls command.
The order corresponds with the number of the flags which is defined in the header file as an enumerated type structure
